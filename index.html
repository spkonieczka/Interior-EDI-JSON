		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>The EDI Files provides access to human readable / stakeholder useable versions of the U.S. government's enterprise data inventories (EDI).  EDIs are agency maintained indexes of the unit's data holdings.  Thanks to years of effort by The <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2015/03/02/after-sunlight-foia-comprehensive-data-indexes-arrive-on-data-gov/" target="_blank">Sunlight Foundation</a>, in March 2015 U.S. government agencies began releasing their EDIs to <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=%22enterprise+data+inventory%22&sort=score+desc%2C+name+asc&ext_location=&ext_bbox=&ext_prev_extent=-142.03125%2C8.754794702435618%2C-59.0625%2C61.77312286453146" target="_blank">Data.gov</a>. Those data, however, were provided in formats that are not easily accessible to most people, and difficult for even the experienced to navigate.  The EDI Files is an effort to re-present the available EDIs in ways that (most) everyone can read and use.</p>

		<h1>Release Notes</h1>
		<p><span class="strong">2015-05-10 &nbsp;(alpha, 0.0.1)</span> &ndash; The alpha release of The EDI Files is the first step towards making the inventory data useful to a broad audience.  For the alpha release, the available EDIs have been parsed and formatted into static tables.  The alpha release represents a significant improvement in access over source data files (available <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=%22enterprise+data+inventory%22&sort=score+desc%2C+name+asc&ext_location=&ext_bbox=&ext_prev_extent=-142.03125%2C8.754794702435618%2C-59.0625%2C61.77312286453146" target="_blank">here</a>), but there remains much work to be done.</p> 

		<h2>Data Files</h2>
		<p>In developing the alpha version of The EDI Files, no changes were made to source <i>data</i> (however, see note on "unspaced strings" below).  Changes to source <i>files</i> were necessary for purposes of parsing and re-presenting data.  For that reason, The EDI Files uses locally hosted copies of the original EDI data files with a small bit of added code. Again, the integrity of source data is unaltered.</p>
		<p>At the time of The EDI File's alpha release, not all agencies had made their EDI's public, not all agencies used the same data format, and a few agencies had errors in their data structure.  For those reasons, data presented is incomplete at the whole-of-government level.  The following traits of data available in the alpha release should be noted:</p> 
		<ul class="bullets">
			<li>Agencies that have not yet made their EDI data set available are marked by red text in the list of databases above. Please alert me if I have overlooked and set's availablity.</li>  
			<li class="topspace">The beta release of The EDI Files was developed for the JSON data exchange format in which most agencies provided EDI data.  The General Services Administration (GSA) has provided a CSV formatted data set that is not part of The EDI File's alpha release.  GSA's EDI data is available <a href="https://gsa.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/30000001G26s/a/30000000Pzv2/PMJx2mkF8_Rna4ZHfBW0deI2CEYwb9B1.7pwZbS8Gl8" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
			<li class="topspace">  Data files from three agencies&mdash;Treasury, Energy, and Agriculture&mdash;contained formatting errors that prevented including those data in The EDI Files alpha release. Original data files from those agencies can be found at <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=%22enterprise+data+inventory%22&sort=score+desc%2C+name+asc&ext_location=&ext_bbox=&ext_prev_extent=-142.03125%2C8.754794702435618%2C-59.0625%2C61.77312286453146" target="_blank">Data.gov</a>. If you (or someone you know) can fix those files so that they conform to JSON standards, please provide a link to corrected copies. I don't know when I'll find the time to fix them myself.</li>
			<li class="topspace">No cleaning or verification of source EDI data were performed. You will/may encounter empty data cells, null values, poorly formatted information, broken links, and other problems.  Such matters are the sole responsibility of the agencies.</li>
			<li class="topspace">For purposes of formatting, several fields from the EDI source data are not included in the alpha release. Excluded fields include "identifer," contactPoint.fn," "language," "bureauCode," and "programCode." Locally hosted data files contain all original source data, including fields not displayed.</li>
			<li class="topspace">Certain datum in source EDI data files consist of unspaced strings (e.g., This_is_an_unspaced_string). Entries using unspaced strings prevent text wrapping, leading to data table formatting errors.  Unspaced strings are being identified and altered to include spaces.</li>
			<li class="topspace">UPDATE (5/11/15): The source EDI files locate URLs in different fields which caused the parsing script to break. Until the problem is fixed, URLs have been removed.  "Identifier" values have been added to assist in locating URLs in source data. (To view source data: (1) Navigate to the relevant data table. (2) Use your browser's "View Page Source" feature. (3) Scroll to bottom of page. (4) Click the second link below the "<\body>" tag with the directory "../datasets_json/filename.json.") Note that identifiers were supplied by agencies, and may not be very useful. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, for instance, uses the integers 1&ndash;34 as resource identifiers.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Design</h2>
		<p>The entire alpha release of The EDI Files was built by hand, by a single person, in two days. Mark-up and CSS are not always pretty, and rendering in different browsers has not been tested.  The site's functionality is minimal, its design modest (and sometimes less-than pleasing), and there may be undiscovered bugs (as well as writing errors). Color scheme is not a patriotic statement, but a result of "red" and "blue" being easy to type, and nicely contrasting.</p>
		<h2>Functionality</h2>
		<p>Finally, no effort was made to work with dated browsers, but there shouldn't be any problems.  The site is low-tech, although JavaScript must be enabled to view data tables.  </p>

			<p>As part of my continued learning, I am planning to build additional database functionality into the site, but EDI data sets are huge, with lots of potential.  There's many things that can be done to make the EDI data sets more accessible and useful.
