 "description": "Second paragraph of Abstract should read:  Biscayne Bay, Card Sound, and Barnes Sound are underlain by a shallow, northsouth trending late Pleistocene bedrock basin 2 to 6 meters in depth. It is bordered to the east by a ridge formed by the Key Largo limestone, to the northwest by a ridge of the Oolite member of the Miami limestone, and to the southwest by the low platform of the Everglades. The Basin was first invaded by the sea about 6,000 years ago during the postglacial Holocene rise of sea level. Sedimentation that has taken place during the subsequent period of slowly rising sea level has been controlled by sediment supply and bedrock topography through its influence on wave energy, tidal currents and winddriven circulation.",
